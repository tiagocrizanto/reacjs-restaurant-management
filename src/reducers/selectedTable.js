/** The selectedTable reducer is in charge of handling the state changes to the selectedTable attribute of the overall state.
 * The selectedTable state should just be a single integer that represents the id of the selected table. The state is initialized to null. 
 * The reducer only handles the SELECT_TABLE action. In the SELECT_TABLE action logic, if the dispatched action contains an id that is already selected, 
 * we return null to deselect the table. Otherwise, we return the action id to select the table.
